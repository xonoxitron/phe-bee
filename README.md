# phe-bee üêù | Partially Homomorphic Encryption Sandbox

![ElGamal Encryption Scheme](./ElGamal-Encryption-Scheme.png "ElGamal Encryption Scheme")

## Description

This Python sandbox is an implementation of the **Partially Homomorphic Encryption** scheme using the **ElGamal Cryptosystem**. We first cover the key generation, encryption, and decryption, by following the mathematical principles behind the **ElGamal‚Äôs Partially Homomorphic** features, which allow for certain computations to be performed on encrypted data.

The **phe-bee** can perform two types of **Homomorphic** operations:

* Homomorphic Addition: Allows adding two encrypted values to get the encrypted sum or to add an encrypted value to a **constant**.

* Homomorphic Multiplication: Allows us to multiply an encrypted value by a **constant** to get the encrypted product.
